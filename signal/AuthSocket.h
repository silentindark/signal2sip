// Authenticated request/response client over Signal's persistent WebSocket
// (wss://chat.signal.org/v1/websocket/), C++ port of layer1/authSocket.js.
// Some Signal-Server endpoints (e.g. PUT /v2/keys) only exist as an
// HTTP-over-websocket call - there is no plain REST equivalent - so this is
// a required transport, not a convenience wrapper.
//
// Implemented on top of libsignal's own C FFI chat-connection client
// (libsignal-net-chat, signal_authenticated_chat_connection_* in
// signal_ffi.h) as of 2026-08-12 - previously a hand-rolled libwebsockets
// client. Switched after a real production threading bug in the old
// implementation (see AuthSocket.cpp's own history) led to discovering
// this FFI surface is Signal-iOS's own sole, production chat transport and
// already has proxy/censorship-circumvention support built in, which the
// hand-rolled version would have had to reimplement from scratch (see
// project memory: signal2sip-authsocket-ffi-migration). This class's own
// public API is unchanged by that migration - every existing caller needed
// zero changes.
