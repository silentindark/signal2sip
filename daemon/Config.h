// signal2sip.conf parser - minimal hand-rolled INI reader (no new
// dependency; matches this project's existing preference for small
// hand-rolled parsing over pulling in a library for something this simple
// - see AuthSocket.cpp/pjsip-gateway.cpp's own hand-rolled JSON field
// extraction). Section-and-key-value only, `;`/`#` comments - but ONLY as
// their own whole line. There is no inline/trailing-comment support: a
// line like `sip_extension=foo # my trunk` puts the literal text
// `foo # my trunk` (space, `#`, and all) into the value - found live as
// the actual cause of a PJSIP_EINVALIDURI failure (a commented-out
// annotation left on the same line as a real sip_extension= value). Put
// comments on their own line above the setting they refer to instead.
//
// One process now serves N Signal accounts (each optionally with its own
// SIP trunk) from a single file, all sharing one database (see
// GlobalConfig/Storage's own doc comments) - one `[global]` section plus
// a repeated `[account.<name>]` section per account.
//
// `<name>` is a purely arbitrary label you choose - any string valid in
// an INI section header (letters/digits/hyphen/underscore, no spaces or
// brackets). It carries no meaning to Signal or SIP; the daemon only uses
// it as (1) this account's key in its internal accounts map, (2) the
// prefix on every log line for this account (`[daemon][<name>] ...`),
// (3) the `account_name` column value scoping this account's rows in the
// shared database. The account's real identity is `e164=`/its derived
// ACI, not `<name>` - so `[account.support-line]`, `[account.alice]`, and
// `[account.380000000001]` are all equally valid, and don't need to
// relate to the phone number at all. (Historically this project used the
// e164 digits with no `+` as the label, purely as a convention when this
// was the only naming idea around - not a requirement, and no longer
// even the example used in this project's own test configs, which now
// prefer names like `caller`/`listener` describing each account's role
// instead.)
//
// Was one account/one file per process (matching tg2sip-webrtc's own
// model) - deliberately reversed since tg2sip has no real
// in-process-multi-account precedent to mirror; see the project's memory
// for that decision.
//
// argv[1] -> /etc/signal2sip/signal2sip.conf -> ./signal2sip.conf,
// matching tg2sip/utils.cpp's resolve_config_path() exactly (same
// fallback order, same rationale: works both installed via systemd and
// run from a dev checkout).
